    "The task involves mining people's opinions of product features within Amazon reviews. I will be using a similar approach to Hu and Liu, 2004. From the reviews of each product product features can be extracted, by extracting nouns and noun phrases using PoS tags and chunking. Once the product features are identified for a product, the opinions can be mined by looking for sentences within the reviews which mention the product features identified and include sentiment-bearing words, such as adjectives. Sentiment analysis using a lexicon can then be used to label each product feature mentioned as being positive or negative. Once this process is complete summaries can be produced to show the number of positive and negative review sentences for each of the product features identified. This process can be carried out for all of the different products in the data."

    "This step requires product features to be extracted from the review sentences. Here, I am using the SpaCy module to make use of the PoS tagger and chunking algorithms. As in the approach by Hu and Liu, I have extracted all the nouns and nounphrases from the corpus to use as potential product features to mine opinions on. I create a dictionary for the nouns and nounphrases (nouns), which has the word as the key and the number of times the word appears in the corpus as the value. I filter this dictionary of nouns and nounphrases by only including ones which occur in more than 1% (Ibid) of review sentences, as it can be expected that people reviewing the same product will talk about the same kinds of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "I process the list of frequent features, first removing stopwords because if they are occurring in nounphrases it reduces the chance of matching the ground truth product features. There were some unigrams in the list that were stopwords, so after removing them there were blank list entries which needed to be removed. I also removed duplicates from the list as this could cause errors to propogate in the sentiment analysis stage. As can be seen from the print statements, this processing is beneficial as it reduces the list of frequent features from 114 down to 83.\n",

If there is an adjective, the sentiment of the adjective is looked up in the sentiment lexicon. From experimenting with this step, I found that allowing any sentiment figure would result in a lot of sentiment words with scores very close to 0, including examples like 'optical', which had a very low negative score, but due to the context was appearing a lot and would have skewed the results significantly. Plus it doesn't seem logical to be either positive or negative. Because of this, I introduced a minimum threshold of 0.2, for both positive and negative sentiments. Additionally, if the adjective has a negation dependency, then I multiply by -1 to reverse the sentiment polarity."

    "Below is the code which runs through the entire application from start to finish for every dataset provided. The results are very poor. The highest statistic is for the Canon S100 with a precision of 0.047. Recall tends to be even lower than precision most of the time, showing that false negatives are more of a problem than false positives (albeit only slightly, as both are very poor). This shows that my classification just wasn't able to pick out the correct product features a lot of the time. The much lower number of distinct product features shows that my design choice to just use nouns and nounphrases was perhaps too limited and simplified."

    "Despite the bad evaluation results, reading out the summaries below is encouraging. There is a good example of negation working in the 'setting' product feature. One of the positive examples is \"with the automatic setting i really have nt\n",
    "taken a bad picture yet\". As it includes the word bad, without any negation handling one would expect it to be categorized as negative. This shows that the problem with my classification approach is that the product features it is choosing are very different, and certainly more limited than the ground truth, but the sentiment analysis itself is working very well, as one can see from manually checking the summaries that positive and negative sentences are being correctly classified."
